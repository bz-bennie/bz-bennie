## Hi there! 👋
I'm passionate about Cyber Security and Computer Science, and this space is where I document and catalog my learning journey. From hands-on projects to study notes, you'll find a mix of security tools, code experiments, and everything in between.

Currently preparing for the CompTIA Security+ certification, I'm diving deep into network security, cryptography, and risk management. Follow along as I build, break, and secure systems while expanding my knowledge.

Feel free to explore my repositories or connect—I'm always open to collaborating and sharing insights!
